# brain-dump

The point of this little script is to help You easily clear Your mind of thoughts, for better thinking, planning, etc.

You do this by writing down whatever thought occurs to You, until none do(?) - which may take 7 hours or whole day to finish.
Or You may choose to write only some of them down. 
Anyway, it is my experience that once written down, the thing no longer clutters the mind so much, and one can spend the energy on other things.

### :fork_and_knife: How to use:
- The script creates a folder/file.txt in the folder where it's placed.
- Write what You want, then press `Enter` to write next entry.
- Write `end` to exit the script.
